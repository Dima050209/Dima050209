## üíº Experience

### **GlobalLogic ‚Äì Frontend Developer**  

At GlobalLogic, I worked on creating **forms for driver and vehicle registration**, including driver‚Äìvehicle assignments, using **React Hook Form** and **Zod**, which made driver‚Äìvehicle management seamless. I developed **availability tables with React Table** to help managers quickly monitor operations and implemented **Recharts-based dashboards** to visualize KPIs, enabling faster data-driven decisions.  

To improve code quality and maintainability, I increased **TypeScript coverage**, enabled strict mode, and minimized `any`/`unknown` usage. Applying **Feature-Sliced Design** principles improved development speed and onboarding efficiency. I also **optimized performance** through code-splitting and lazy loading, reducing initial load times.  

**Technologies:** React.js, Next.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Tanstack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, Shadcn/ui, Jest

### **Promova ‚Äì Frontend Developer**  

At Promova, I built a **role-based dashboard system** from scratch using **Next.js Router API** and **Tanstack Query**, which improved UX by showing users only the routes they could access. I enhanced question/answer pages with **Shadcn/ui**, making progress tracking and validation more intuitive.  

I also worked with **JWT authentication**, setting up private route protection and access/refresh token management, which streamlined the user experience and avoided unnecessary reauthorization. To ensure high code quality, I wrote **unit and integration tests with Jest**, which helped reduce the bug rate by around 5%.  

**Technologies:** React.js, Next.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Tanstack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, Shadcn/ui, Jest
